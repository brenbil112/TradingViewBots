Step-by-Step Guide to Manually Emulating the Strategy

1. Identify Key Support & Resistance Levels (Higher Timeframe - 15 min)
Find the lowest low of the last 15 minutes.
Find the highest high of the last 15 minutes.
These levels act as dynamic support and resistance zones.

2. Detect Breakdowns & Breakouts on the 1-Minute Chart
Breakdown: Price crosses below the 15-min low and closes below it.
Breakout: Price crosses above the 15-min high and closes above it.

3. Confirm Momentum & Volatility
Use RSI (14):
Bearish Momentum: RSI < 35 and price is below the 15-min low.
Bullish Momentum: RSI > 65 and price is above the 15-min high.

Use ATR (14):
ATR must be greater than its 14-period average to confirm sufficient volatility.

4. Trend Confirmation Using EMAs
9 EMA (Fast) & 50 EMA (Slow):
Short trade: Price is below both EMAs.
Long trade: Price is above both EMAs.

Volume Confirmation:
Current volume must be above its 20-period moving average.

5. Entry Rules

Short Entry:
Breakdown confirmed.
RSI < 35, strong bearish momentum.
ATR > its 14-period SMA (high volatility).
Price is below both 9 EMA and 50 EMA.
Volume is above its 20-period moving average.

Long Entry:
Breakout confirmed.
RSI > 65, strong bullish momentum.
ATR > its 14-period SMA (high volatility).
Price is above both 9 EMA and 50 EMA.
Volume is above its 20-period moving average.

6. Stop-Loss & Take-Profit
Short Trade:
Stop-loss: Set slightly above the highest high of the last 5 bars + ATR * 0.2.
Take-profit: Set at current price - ATR * 2.0.

Long Trade:
Stop-loss: Set slightly below the lowest low of the last 5 bars - ATR * 0.2.
Take-profit: Set at current price + ATR * 2.0.

7. Execution & Trade Management

Mark entries with a down arrow (▼) for shorts and an up arrow (▲) for longs.
Exit trades at either stop-loss or take-profit levels.
Monitor volume and momentum to ensure market conditions remain valid for your trade.
If market conditions change, consider manual exit before stop-loss is hit.

By following these steps, you can manually execute trades using the same logic as the automated strategy. Consistently apply these rules and track performance to optimize your trading decisions!
